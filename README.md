# class-for-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is for my personal use and for sharing with my co-learners
This class has few basic functions like scatterplot, scatterplot matrix, a function to check whether the categories are roughly 
equal in numbers. I have a plan to add more functions to this class.
